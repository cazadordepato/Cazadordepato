        <p>I went on the opener of the duck and goose hunt today.  We had six people all together hunting in our party.  There was Chad and his Daughter, Ashton and Connor, and Skyler and myself.  We managed to shoot 21 geese and 21 ducks.  One goose was banded and two of the geese were speckle bellies which are really rare. It was a great hunt and we had lots of fun looking forward to more great hunts in the future.</p>

        <p> What a whirlwind of a weekend it has been it is fall break so I had Thursday and Friday off of work, which meant hunting!  I started Thursday by taking a couple of my part time workers out.  They didn't have much for gear besides shotguns, so we couldn't go most of the places that I usually go, but we had a lot of fun and even managed to get a duck. Friday I went with Skyler and Connor to ogden bay and we managed to get two teal and a widgeon hen, but things were rather slow, so we packed up and headed to skylers house where we dropped connor of and headed up to the bear river bird refuge.  We met up with one of skylers friends from the poliece force up there and headed out to unit 3.  We found a great place and threw out our decoys and ditched the boats in the reeds a ways off and hunkered down in the cattails to wait for the birds to come in.  It didn't take long and they started to fly.  Most of them were Pintails, but there was the occasional mallard, gadwall, or widgeon.  we stayed until about 5:30 pm and managed to get ten ducks.  It was one of the best hunting opportunities that I have had.  The mud in the water was nice and hard and made the walking really easy and nice.  Saturday we couldn't hunt till the afternoon, so we stayed close to home and went to Ogden Bay again.  We set up in a different spot and started to wait for the birds to fly.  The weather was supposed to turn bad and start raining when it finally did the birds started flying and we had another great shoot and managed to limit out both of us.  We shot a few teal, gadwalls, and mostly Widgeon.  It was cold and wet but really great!!! What a way to end a hunting marathon of a weekend!!!  </p>
